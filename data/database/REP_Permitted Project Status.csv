511,Yes,No,Yes,No,"Historically, poor water quality groundwater in the Mission Basin (the San Luis Rey River) forced the City to import the majority of its supply from the San Diego County Water Authority. Currently, approximately 83% of the City’s annual customer demand is met with imported water. Waters diverted through the City’s wells is brackish (1600 mg/L tds), which requires that 80% of the City’s production is treated by reverse osmosis (desalination) and then blended for municipal use. The Mission Basin Desalter Facility (MBDF), which was constructed in 1992, has a treated water production capacity of 6.3 gpd (or approximately 7,050 afy). The City has undertaken several significant upgrades of the MBDF. In 2004, the City expanded the MBDF’s treatment capacity from 2.0 MGD to 6.4 MGD. In 2009, the City completed installation of a granular activated carbon (GAC) treatment system to remove 1, 2, 3 trichloropropane (TCP) from the source water in Wells 1, 2, 3, 9, 10 and 11. Additionally, the City has also upgraded its production and distribution system. In 2014, the City completed construction of a new 4.5 mgd booster station in order to increase the City's water flow from its “320 pressure zone” to its “511 pressure zone,” which will maintain distribution flows throughout the system. These upgrades have expanded the City’s capacity to maximize its beneficial use of water under Permit 5229. The City owns and operates 8 production wells. Currently, the City is undertaking an optimization study of its existing wells to assess whether any improvements are required to maximize the wells’ full production potential. The optimization study is in the evaluation stages and further testing will be required to determine whether additional construction will be required to maximize beneficial use of water pursuant to Permit 5229.

In 1994, SCVWD implemented National Marine Fisheries Service  guidelines with respect to the approach velocity for the fish screens installed at the Penitencia Creek diversion facility. In 1995, SCVWD signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, which required SCVWD to make a 1 cubic foot per second (cfs) bypass flow through the diversion dam at this facility at all times. In 1998, SCVWD constructed a fish ladder and revised operation for the diversion dam to maintain flow of at least 2.5 cfs through the ladder for the benefit of fish and public trust resources. In 2000, SCVWD defined a 10-year stream maintenance program (SMP) to comply with the California Environmental Quality Act and provide Endangered Species Act coverage for sediment removal during summer only and vegetation from streams as necessary to provide flood protection.  The SMP precluded removing winter blockages and maintaining the rotating drum type fish screen at the diversion on Upper Penitencia Creek.

	Maximum diversion to storage and rate of direct diversion under Permit 16478 has reached the quantities authorized under the permit.  Additional time is required to maximize beneficial use authorized under the remaining permits governing SWP operations at Oroville and in the Delta, Permits 16479, 16481 and 16482.  Annual diversions to storage are dependent on end of season storage, hydrology and State Water Project demands and regulatory constraints.  Maximum diversion rate, total annual diversion to storage and maximum annual use are expected to increase as demands within the SWP service area increase.  DWR filed a petition for time extension on December 31, 2010.  There are a number of factors creating uncertainty as to the ultimate demands for project water and the quantities available and timing of diversions including the current Bay-Delta Conservation Plan process.  At this time, DWR is requesting a 5 year extension to allow time for the current planning processes to be completed.

2588,Yes,No,Yes,No,"The City of Solvang diverts water from the underflow of the Santa Ynez River using wells. The pumping capacity of the City's current wells is not sufficient to fully appropriate the quantities allowed by the City's permit. The City therefore plans to install new wells, both to increase its pumping capacity and to replace other wells that have been damaged by past flooding, in order to prove up its use under its permit. The City prepared a comprehensive ""water master plan"" for the City's current and future water needs and development. The wells are part of the water master plan. The City updated the water master plan in 2010 (the ""Master Plan Update"") and is now nearing completion of the environmental review process of the Master Plan Update. The State Water Resources Control Board has required evidence that the City has complied with the California Environmental Quality Act (""CEQA"") in connection with the installation of any new wells. The City contracted with URS Corporation to prepare the City's necessary environmental documents. A Notice of Preparation was issued December 4, 2002 for a thirty-day public review period. Due to a series of delays, the internal administrative draft was issued in November of 2004 with a second draft put on hold in October 2006. The second draft was put on hold to allow for negotiation of a mutual agreement between the City and the Santa Ynex River Water Conservation District, Improvement District No. 1, regarding mitigation of additional wells drawing from the Santa Ynez River underflow. The parties have since entered into a memorandum of understanding regarding mitigation of additional wells drawing from the Santa Ynez River underflow. In early 2011, Stetson Engineers Inc. completed technical studies and modeling to develop an initial well location and pumping plan for the City to minimize any impacts to other water users. Due to modifications in the Master Plan Update, the City (through URS) issued a second Notice of Preparation for the EIR on January 4, 2011. Numerous comments were received. After many discussions between the City and URS, they made the mutual determination that the City should engage another contractor to complete the EIR. Solvang then engaged Impact Sciences, who completed the first and second administrative draft EIR. The lead biologist working on the EIR, and his team, left Impact Sciences around March 2012 to form a new firm. With the second draft EIR completed, the City decided to hire the new firm, Meridian Consultants, to complete the EIR. The City relealsed the DRaft EIR on June 15, 2012 for public comment.  The public comment period closed on July 30, 2012. The City received numerous comments and is currently finalizing its responses to comments and developing additional mitigation measures in response to those comments, which will be included in the Final EIR.",12/31/2017,,,,,,Not Complete,,A022423,http://ciwqs.waterboards.ca.gov/ciwqs/ewrims_online_reporting/viewReport.do?formId=111846

Due to a series of delays, the internal administrative draft was issued in November of 2004 with a second draft put on hold in October of 2006.  The second draft was put on hold to allow for negotiation of a mutual agreement to be negotiated between the City of Solvang and the Santa Ynez River Water Conservation District, Improvement District No. 1 regarding mitigation of additional wells drawing from the Santa Ynez River underflow.  The parties have since entered into a memorandum of understanding regarding mitigation of additional wells drawing from the Santa Ynez River underflow.  In early 2011 Stetson Engineers Inc. completed initial technical studies and modeling to develop a well location and pumping plan for the City to minimize any impacts to other water users.  The City engaged URS to prepare the environmental review for Master Plan Update.  The Notice of Preparation for the EIR was issued on January 4, 2011.  Numerous comments were received.  After numerous discussions between the City and URS, they made the mutual determination that the City should engage another contractor to complete the EIR.

Permit 15913 grants the right to directly divert up to 2.3 cubic-feet per second (cfs) year round (January 1st to December 31st), not to exceed 133 af annually, and to collect to storage up to 300 af annually during the period of September 1 through June 1. Of this storage amount, 270 af may be stored at Lake Emily and 30 af may be stored in the former Summer Lake Reservoir. However, due to restrictions imposed by California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) to protect fisheries, the Summer Lake dam is no longer used and therefore Summer Lake no longer functions as a reservoir. 

Operationally, water directly diverted and withdrawn from storage at Lake Emily is transferred to and regulated at Lake Ada Rose before it is treated at the BTCSD drinking water treatment facility adjacent to Lake Ada Rose.

In total, storage and direct diversion authorized under Permit 15913 is 433 afa [133 afa + 270 afa + 30 afa]. However, the 30 afa permitted for storage in Summer Lake has not been utilized since the reservoir was abandoned to meet CDFG requirements under the Streambed Alteration Agreement (SAA) Notification 1600-2006-0822-3 between CDFG and BTCSD, as amended (CDFG, 2007).

The SCADA project is approaching the final test phase.  That said, the California Department of Fish and Game has filed a frivolous protest to the Special District's proposed annexation of the Park.

3437,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,We have applied for a permit with California Department of Fish and Wildlife to repair a streambed that was damaged by an outflow of water from from the reservoir. We are reviewing the paperwork at this time and should have the permit within two weeks. We are also exploring the possibility of relocating the overflow channel to the north side of the dam. This will allow us to use the maximum amount of water.,10/15/2016,,,,,,Not Complete,,A024425,http://ciwqs.waterboards.ca.gov/ciwqs/ewrims_online_reporting/viewReport.do?formId=112051
3438,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,"We purchased the vineyard in November 2012. The property had a slump that needed to be repaired as well as issues with the location of the spillway. The slump repair was permitted mid 2013 and was completed in October of 2013. The spillway is still an issue and we are only allowed to hold up to 210 acre feet of water to ensure the spillway is not used. (permitted storage amount of water is 250 acre feet)

The current phase includes modeling by the USGS Hydrologists, Dr.'s Alan and Lorraine Flint who are organizing the research and are producing a proposal for funding.
The potential being examined is whether increasing soil carbon will enhance the soil water holding capacity to greater amount than above ground catchment. Based on this next step, we plan to conduct small experiments with off-channel ponds and paired soil carbon amended sites to measure the difference and determine our path forward.",04/30/2024,,,,,,Not Complete,,A028971,http://ciwqs.waterboards.ca.gov/ciwqs/ewrims_online_reporting/viewReport.do?formId=157159

11364,,,,,,,Yes,No,No,06/30/2012,During 2010 the Big Sur Land Trust continued to prepare the land for conversion back to organic agricultural operations and habitat restoration following several years of phased work for restoration of the lagoon on State Parks property and interim agricultural operations. Due to economic issues and a tightening of farm loans our agricultural producer left the property in late 2008 and the land was only minimumly farmed in 2009 and 2010. From 2009 to 2010 the Big Sur Land Trust conducted design work and assessment of the property for the grading of a permanent farm operation raised out of the 100-year floodplain as well as conversion of some portion of the land to native habitat. 60% designs are now complete and project permits have been submitted with a construction date of early Spring 2012 identified to raise the farm field out of the 100-year floodplain and complete other items such as a new farm road and some habitat restoration. During 2011 the land will be used to grow native plants and to force sprout weeds in the farmland to proactively convert some portions of the property back to native habitat through an active mowing and weeding regime. An agricultural operator will be identified this winter for the property with a date of agricultural production to be restarted in late Spring 2012.,Not Complete,No,A030497A,http://ciwqs.waterboards.ca.gov/ciwqs/ewrims_online_reporting/viewReport.do?formId=49984

12583,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,"San Bernardino Valley Municipal Water District (Valley District) and Western Municipal Water District of Riverside County (Western), (jointly, Permittees) are pursuing an aggressive program to construct the facilities needed to put the water permitted under Permit Number 21264 (Application 31165) and Permit Number 21265 (Application 31370) to beneficial use.  Permittees anticipate that they will complete the construction of the facilities by October 1, 2020.  The initial phase of work was commenced prior to June 30, 2010 and involved modification of the intake structure at the Cuttle Weir to increase the diversion rate from approximately 195 cfs to approximately 300 cfs.  Presently, Permittees are designing the first phase of the Plunge Pool Pipeline, sedimentation basins, canal and additional recharge basins that will increase the transmission and recharge capacity to 500 cfs at the Santa Ana River recharge basins.  The first phase of the Plunge Pool Pipeline will be constructed to deliver water to the recharge basins and to Valley District's Foothill Pipeline.  A future phase of the Plunge Pool Pipeline will provide added flexibility by connecting to the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California Inland Feeder.  With the  completion of the first phase facilities, Permittees will be able to divert up to 500 cfs from the Santa Ana River and deliver that water:  (i) for groundwater recharge into underground storage for subsequent extraction and use by the retail agencies in the place of use of Permit 21264 and 21265, (ii) for direct deliveries to retail water agencies within the place of use through the Foothill Pipeline and/or the Inland Feeder, or (iii) some combination of (i) and (ii).  The plans for the first phase of the Plunge Pool Pipeline and additional recharge basins are presently in draft form and additional environmental documentation is being prepared.

A future phase of the Plunge Pool Pipeline will provide added flexibility by connecting to the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California Inland Feeder.  With the completion of the first phase facilities, Permittees will be able to divert up to 500 cfs from the Santa Ana River and deliver that water: (i) for groundwater recharge into underground storage for subsequent extraction and use by the retail water agencies in the place of use under Permits 21264 and 21265, (ii) for direct deliveries to retail water agencies within the place of use though the Foothill Pipeline and/or the Inland Feeder, or (iii) some combination of (i) and (ii).
