There are no in-stream pumps or screens in use. The source for these offset wells is either the subterranean stream of the Russian River and/or an underground aquifer. The actual source for the offset wells has not yet been confirmed. The topography of the property is such that we get runoff from the top of the hills above the vineyards that flows into low lying areas during a normal year of precipitation from November to April (see attached map). Much of this water percolates into French drains located in the upper hills and under our low lying vineyards. This water then flows into our two ponds. This is a considerable amount of water that is stored in the ponds and can last into Spring without pumping from the wells. The topography of the property also allows the rainfall and well water to ultimately return down to the Main Stem Russian River. We can prove that the source of origin for our major requirements during a normal rainfall year can be primarily from our deeded property from the numerous drain tiles and a naturally occurring high water table. We therefore claimed a large portion of water originating from conservation measures and groundwater.,All diverted water is controlled by drippers which are controlled by timers.,All diverted water is conveyed by pipe.,All diverted water is returned directly to stream approximately 500 feet below the point of diversion.,All diverted water not immediately used is diverted back to stream of origin.

By October, annual rainfall was well below average and reservoir capacity had fallen below 75%. Therefore, to prepare for the possibility of a dry 2014, the Stage 1 alert was extended indefinitely for the remainder of 2013 due to dry conditions and low stream flow.","Conservation efforts from new and existing water conservation programs/activities in 2012 accounted for long-term savings of approximately 12.9 million gallons per year.

In order to induce conservation within its service territory, the City utilizes tiered rates, residential and commercial surveys, educational outreach, and ultra-low flush toilet and high efficiency clothes washer rebates.  The City¿s water demands reached a record low in calendar year 2015 as a result of ongoing and enhanced conservation efforts coupled with state-mandated emergency conservation restrictions. In response to a multi-year drought and the governor¿s declaration of a Drought State of Emergency, water providers statewide increased conservation, enforcement and reporting. With the target on landscape inefficiencies, restrictions were enacted to prohibit outside irrigation to no more than two assigned days per week and to prohibit the irrigation of turf grass on public street medians. Efficiency and water wise practices such as not irrigating during and 48 hours after rainfall and prohibiting water use resulting in hardscape runoff have become permanent mandatory restrictions that will remain in place long after the drought response levels have been lifted. In addition to more efficient and timely maintenance, 2015 saw the transformation of many landscapes from water thirsty turf to more drought tolerant native designs contributing to a reduction in water use.","Conservation numbers are calculated off of the difference of gallons per capita per day (GPCD) for the calendar year based on the  baseline GPCD of 170 in the City Water Conservation Master Plan.

For the second year in a row, the City declared a Stage 3 Water Shortage Emergency effective May 1, 2015 as a result of historic statewide drought conditions. The Stage 3 regulations aimed to reduce system-wide peak season water use by 20 percent and maintain Loch Lomond reservoir at or above 58 percent of total capacity at the end of October. Regulations included rationing for residential and large irrigation accounts and outdoor water use restrictions for all customers. Rationing and restrictions reduced water production from 3.35 billion gallons in 2013 to 2.48 billion gallons in 2015, a difference of 873 million gallons or 26 percent. Savings in potable water production far surpassed the drought emergency water conservation target of 8 percent assigned by the State Water Board.","Cumulative water savings from water conservation programs since 2000 amount to approximately 291 million gallons per year. Programs in 2014 accounted for long-term savings of about 34 million gallons. One highly successful program in 2014 involved installation of low water use pre-rinse spray valves in food service establishments throughout the water service area. This program alone generated long-term savings of 7.9 million gallons per year. The City declared a Stage 3 Water Shortage Emergency effective May 1, 2014 as a result of poor hydrological conditions from three consecutive dry years as well as reduced surface flow diversions to maintain habitat for threatened and endangered fish species. Regulations included rationing for residential and large irrigation accounts and outdoor water use restrictions for all customers. Rationing and restrictions reduced water production from 3.4 billion gallons in 2013 to 2.6 billion gallons in 2014, a difference of 783 million gallons or 23 percent. This reduction reflected a significant drop in both overall gpcd to 76 and residential gpcd to 49.",Current configurations of the discharge pipes from the pumps require modification to meet manufacturer's specifications.

The estimate in 5b. is based on  using ITRC REPORT 03-001 ETc Table for Irrigation Scheduling and Design, Zone 14 for Surface Irrigation, Typical year adjusted for the reporting year using CIMIS monthly ETo for Lodi West. For crops not covered by the ITRC report ETc was determined using ratios to alfalfa from Table A-5, DWR Bulletin 168, October 1978. The total consumptive use for 12 months was allocated among the months that diversion took place. Diversion amounts for those months were then estimated by multiplying these resulting monthly use amounts by a factor to account for additional water that is diverted but not consumed or evaporated. Taking the average of thusly calculated diversion amounts for the two crops not grown this year minus their calculated consumptive use yields the approximate amount claimed below.","Due to the low flow condition I did not use my pump this year. The water flow was so low during the time I wanted to pump during the summer months (my 1 1/2 horse pump would pump more than the creek would flow, thus making a dry creek below.

Any diverted water which is not consumed or evaporated is recycled to the Delta Pool.   Crops can vary from year to year with some demanding more or less total water than others. When they demand less, water is thereby conserved. The timing and rate of diversion also vary with crop type and the weather, and when that occurs, water is conserved at various times of the year as a result thereof. In addition, the place of use is protected from flooding by levees and those levees result in the conservation of water that would otherwise be lost to evaporation and/or evapotranspiration from wild, uncontrolled vegetation if those levees were not in place and the land reverted to its unreclaimed, swamp and overflowed status. Moreover, the substantial seepage from the river channels into the place of use is continuously collected and returned to those channels thereby effectuating a substantial conservation in water.

The timing and rate of diversion also vary with crop type and the weather, and when that occurs, water is conserved at various times of the year as a result thereof. In addition, the place of use is protected from flooding by levees and those levees result in the conservation of water that would otherwise be lost to evaporation and/or evapotranspiration from wild, uncontrolled vegetation if those levees were not in place and the land reverted to its unreclaimed, swamp and overflowed status. Moreover, the substantial seepage from the river channels into the place of use is continuously collected and returned to those channels thereby effectuating a substantial conservation in water.

Based on this agreement, and our pre 1914 water right for 20 miners inches (225 gpm) of water from Bear Creek, we agreed to take 25 gpm and allow CCWD to take 200 gpm.  That is, CCWD diverts and uses the remainder of the water right confirmed in the judgment in Walsh v. CCWD; Calaveras County Case No. 5430.  This agreement may be terminated by either party with 6 months notice.  The parties entered into this agreement relying upon their existing water rights and CA State Water Code 109, 1011, 11960, 11961, 1244 and other applicable code sections.  A copy of this water conservation agreement is available upon request.  Walsh conserved water through a more efficient water diversion/delivery system and reduced orchard & pasture acreage under irrigation.",In March 2013 we installed a subsurface (drip tape) system and a water meter and totalizer.  Beginning with the 2013 crop year we intend to claim credit as a result of this conservation effort.,In a drought year like this one we use less water.,In a drought year we use less water.,"In accordance with the Governor's guidelines of 25% reduction over base year 2013, irrigation was curtailed on Roughs, approaches and driving ranges while continued on the valuable greens and fairways to ensure continued use.","In accordance with the Sanctuary Forest Forbearance Program, I collect 50,000 gallons of groundwater into storage to be used during the low-flow period when notified by SFI.","In addition to conservation efforts listed in past reports, we have also restricted outdoor watering to 2-days per week and no run-off.","In addition to past conservation efforts, we are also restricting outdoor irrigation for our customers to no more than twice a week.","In an effort to conserve, we irrigate no pasture or lawn areas on the five acres we own.  Water efficient drip irrigation was installed on all young trees and shrubs irrigated. Mulching and other techniques are also used to conserve water used.  An energy/water efficient dishwasher was also installed.","In an effort to conserve, we irrigate no pasture or lawn areas on the five acres we own. Water efficient drip irrigation was installed on all young trees and shrubs irrigated.  All drip irrigation are now on timers that regulate exactly how long each cycle runs, leaving no room for error such as forgetting to turn a hose off. Mulching and other techniques are also used to conserve water used. When we give our son a bath, we do not fill it up all the way and only use as much as needed.  These are just some examples of how we are trying to conserve.","In both orchards and the alfalfa fields good water management and farming practices are utilized depending on weather conditions throughout the year which help us to conserve water on a large scale in addition to lined ditches, pipelines, cover crops, mulching, laser leveling as well constant supervision of the water being diverted so that we do not over irrigate those fields.  Any diverted water which is not consumed or evaporated is recycled to the Delta Pool.  Credit is claimed for these water conservation efforts under section 1011 of the Water Code.  A specific amount conserved is not reported due to the lack of a present method to precisely quantify that amount.","In both orchards and the alfalfa fields good water management and farming practices are utilized depending on weather conditions throughout the year which help us to conserve water on a large scale in addition to lined ditches, pipelines, cover crops, mulching, laser leveling as well constant supervision of the water being diverted so that we do not over irrigate those fields.

We are basing our water consumption on the average gallons of water consumed per head per day.  We are now weaning and selling calves early, and plan to further reduce our herd dramatically.  We will continue to make every effort to adapt to the changing environment.","In cooperation with the USFS cabin owners have been advised to conserve water by restricting outside use.

The City participates in local and regional programs which allow the City's water customers to obtain rebates for smart irrigation equipment, rain barrels, clothes washers, toilets, turf grass replacement and many other water saving upgrades.  Most rebates are available through the ""OC Water Smart"" program overseen by the Municipal Water District of Orange County.  The City maintains a website that describes its water conservation programs and provides useful tips to help customers save water.  The City also employs a Water Conservation Coordinator to disseminate information to its customers.  Going forward, the City will continue to enhance water conservation efforts to comply with water use efficiency goals in Executive Order B-37-16 (May 9, 2016)",In the past 5 years we have worked with NRCS and improved our flood irrigation methods to do the best we could and save water because of the drought,"In the past three years over $5.2 million was invested to boost snowmaking efficiency, reducing the amount of water, compressed air, and power needed to make snow. The investment includes: the installation of fully automated, temperature controlled snowmaking system, improving piping and water flow around the mountain, and investing in new, high-efficiency EVO snow guns.

Currently in Phase 2, the Ordinance limits landscape irrigation to 3 days per week and prohibits wasteful water uses such as hosing down driveways or irrigating within 48 hours of a significant rain event. The Water Conservation Response Unit (WCRU) informs and educates customers about the Ordinance and provides resources to assist in identifying leaks and improving water use efficiency. The Save the Drop Water Conservation Outreach Campaign, in collaboration with the Office of the Mayor, expands public awareness by complementing traditional outreach with engaging social media posts, radio spots, movie theater ads and strategic messages placed in public spaces such as on buses/bus shelters, and advertising billboards. LADWP also offers a variety of rebates and programs to assist customers in using water more efficiently and saving money. Such rebates include the California Friendly Landscape Incentive Program (turf removal and replacement with sustainable landscaping including California Friendly plants) and water saving devices such as high efficiency clothes washers, premium high efficiency toilets, and weather based irrigation controllers. LADWP also offers free faucet aerators, showerheads, and leak detection kits to customers. To assist customers in transitioning away from turf, LADWP provides free classroom based California Friendly Landscape Training, turf removal Hands On Workshops, and a free landscape maintenance book available for download at our website. Additionally, we are developing landscape professional training classes as part of our Los Angeles Outdoor Landscape Academy (LAOLA). These outreach activities, public awareness campaigns, training workshops and rebate programs, have contributed to significant reductions in per-capita water use. Los Angeles has complied with and exceeded State conservation mandates, and is on track to meet the Mayorâ€™s long term sustainability goals outlined in the Sustainable City pLAn, reducing water use by 22.5% by 2025, and 25% by 2035.","Lots this year.

Due to the extreme water shortage in 2015 and to retain additional water in storage in Lake McClure, Merced collected water to storage under its Pre-1914 claim in lieu of direct diversions at its Main Canal.  This action helped raise Lake McClure storage from 6% to more than 13%.  Merced and its constituents relied on groundwater extraction, stress irrigation, and some land fallowing to sustain the third and most devastating dry year on record. Merced diverted some flows in late June of 2015 for about 12 days to supplement groundwater deliveries, however 2015 is marked as the having the lowest Merced River diversions to MID system on record.","Merced, since its inception, has undertaken projects that improve its overall water management and contributes to water conservation. Optimal water conservation efforts are ongoing and include, but are not limited to, good water management and farming practices such as recirculation of tailwater, laser land leveling, crop varietal changes, crop shifts, and weed abatement. The total quantity of water conserved by Merced during each year is variable and depends upon numerous factors, including but not limited to, climatic conditions, hydrologic conditions, Merced?s operational practices, and on-farm operational practices. Differentiating and measuring or quantifying conserved water for some efforts is not possible or feasible due to the complexity of the multiple variables involved. However, Merced has estimated the quantity of water conserved through some efforts.

Differentiating and measuring or quantifying conserved water for some efforts is not possible or feasible due to the complexity of the multiple variables involved. However, Merced has estimated the quantity of water conserved through some efforts. For the purpose of reporting, the annual quantity of water conserved is estimated based on the difference between Mercedâ€™s year of highest diversion under its consumptive use water rights of 698,495 acre-feet in 1987 and the diversions under its consumptive use water rights reported for a particular year. This quantity includes conserved water under Mercedâ€™s Licenses 2685, 6047, 11395, and Statement 4718.

This is primarily done through implementation of Demand Management Measures (DMMs), participation in the Sacramento Water Forum, which includes conformance with the Water Forum Agreement (WFA) and implementation of the California Urban Water Conservation Council (CUWCC) Best Management Practices (BMPs), and participation in the Regional Water Authority (RWA), which includes participation in the RWA's Water Efficiency Program. 
 
The City's commitment to water conservation began in 1991, when the City became a signatory to CUWCC Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) Regarding Urban Water Conservation in California.  The purpose of the MOU was to expedite implementation of reasonable water conservation measures in urban areas and to establish appropriate assumptions for use in calculating estimates of reliable future water conservation savings.  The 1991 MOU originally listed sixteen BMPs for water conservation. In 1999, the MOU was revised to include fourteen BMPs. These fourteen BMPs are substantially similar to the fourteen DMMs listed in the Urban Water Management Planning Act.

The City is also a member of the Sacramento Water Forum, and is a signatory to the WFA which includes seven elements that all signatories to the WFA agreed to endorse and, where appropriate, participate in. The Water Conservation Element of the WFA requires the development and implementation of a water conservation plan that includes fourteen BMPs.  The primary difference between the DMMs/CUWCC BMPs and the WFA BMPs is that the WFA BMPs do not include high efficiency washing machine rebate programs or wholesale agency programs.

The City also is a member of the RWA, which is a joint powers authority that serves and represents the interests of over twenty water providers and associated agencies in the greater Sacramento area. The RWA has a Water Efficiency Program, which is a large-scale effort designed to help participating agencies fulfill commitments to implement their Water Forum water conservation plans. The program provides services with oversight via an advisory committee. Through this regional effort, purveyors are better able to manage BMP implementation projects through coordination and training of staff, regional marketing of services to customers and leveraging resources.

A description of the City's activities with respect to each DMM is provided in Chapter 6 of the City's Urban Water Management Plan (October 2011)","The City of Sacramento is committed to reducing the demand for potable water through conservation. This is primarily done through implementation of Demand Management Measures (DMMs), participation in the Sacramento Water Forum, which includes conformance with the Water Forum Agreement (WFA) and implementation of the California Urban Water Conservation Council (CUWCC) Best Management Practices (BMPs), and participation in the Regional Water Authority (RWA), which includes participation in the RWA's Water Efficiency Program. 
 
The City's commitment to water conservation began in 1991, when the City became a signatory to CUWCC Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) Regarding Urban Water Conservation in California.  The purpose of the MOU was to expedite implementation of reasonable water conservation measures in urban areas and to establish appropriate assumptions for use in calculating estimates of reliable future water conservation savings.  The 1991 MOU originally listed sixteen BMPs for water conservation. In 1999, the MOU was revised to include fourteen BMPs. These fourteen BMPs are substantially similar to the fourteen DMMs listed in the Urban Water Management Planning Act.

The City is also a member of the Sacramento Water Forum, and is a signatory to the WFA which includes seven elements that all signatories to the WFA agreed to endorse and, where appropriate, participate in. The Water Conservation Element of the WFA requires the development and implementation of a water conservation plan that includes fourteen BMPs.  The primary difference between the DMMs/CUWCC BMPs and the WFA BMPs is that the WFA BMPs do not include high efficiency washing machine rebate programs or wholesale agency programs.
The City also is a member of the RWA, which is a joint powers authority that serves and represents the interests of over twenty water providers and associated agencies in the greater Sacramento area. The RWA has a Water Efficiency Program, which is a large-scale effort designed to help participating agencies fulfill commitments to implement their Water Forum water conservation plans. The program provides services with oversight via an advisory committee. Through this regional effort, purveyors are better able to manage BMP implementation projects through coordination and training of staff, regional marketing of services to customers and leveraging resources. Program components include regional public outreach and school education programs, large landscape irrigation efficiency and leak detection programs, and partnerships with other agencies and organizations for rebates on water efficient toilets and clothes washers, and distribution of water-efficiency products.

All diversions are accomplished through offset wells. There are no in-stream pumps or screens in use. The source for these offset wells is either the subterranean stream of the Russian River and/or an underground aquifer. The actual source for the offset wells has not yet been confirmed. The topography of the property is such that we get runoff from the top of the hills above the vineyards that flows into low lying areas during a normal year of precipitation from November to April (see attached map). Much of this water percolates into French drains located in the upper hills and under our low lying vineyards. This water then flows into our two ponds. This is a considerable amount of water that is stored in the ponds and can last into Spring without pumping from the wells. The topography of the property also allows the rainfall and well water to ultimately return to the Main Stem Russian River. We can prove that the source of origin for our major requirements during a normal rainfall year can be primarily from our deeded property from the numerous drain tiles and a naturally occurring high water table.,"We cleaned vegetation from spring, maintained pipelines for leaks, stopped irrigating pasture, maintained watering trough and downsized the cattle herd.","We cleaned vegetation from springs, maintained pipelines for leaks, stopped irrigating pasture, maintained watering trough and downsized the cattle herd.",We collect all water as it is warming up and use it for household plants and flushing toilets.

Upon purchase of the ranch in 1994 we changed the business model from a mobile home park twith 57 licensed hook-ups to a guest ranch targeting a guest pop. of about 30 people. The 57 RVs were each impacting ranch infrastructure and consuming water, generating sewage, and needing the limited power available. The smaller guest population, full, service, guests of a dude ranch generate sufficient income with farr less demand onf the resources.

2. Original flood irrigation of agricultural lands has been upgraded to more efficient sprinkler distribution of water.

3. The original gold rush era cast iron pelt on wheel and generator system was upgraded to a more effiecient bronze wheel and modern generator system in 1997.

4. Transport of canal water has been continuously improved as we line the canal with 1/2 culverts in leaky/suspect areas of the canal. This reduces loss of transported water through leakage.

5. An original gold rush era flume has been replaced with a permanent full culvert system also containing a high flow bypass to return excess Winter flows to Stanshaw creek.

6. Ranch buldings have ALL been upgraded and remodeled with duo pane windows, full insulation, fluorescent light fixtures, modern appliances, and current building technology to reduce the power demands of existing buldings.

7. Past grant applications have been made to return unused power plant effluent to the anadramous sections of Stanshaw creek, and we are currently in grant consideration for on-ground water distribution system upgrades - pending acceptance by Cal Fish and Game","lAND IS LASER LEVELLED.  nO FLOOD IRRIGATION.
